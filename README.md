# Just Draw

A browser based Whiteboard drawing app made with React.

## Lessons Learned

My first encounter with using Refs in React. Really enjoyed
learning how to use them.

Had to learn about the working of refs in depth!
The two use cases of refs :
- accessing a DOM node
- persisting data between renders

seemed challenging and had to dive deep into StackOverflow and 
ReactDocs to understand them.


## Potential Future Features

- Making some buttons that can be used to draw shapes like
  Rectangles, Circles etc.

- Allow user to be able to select the color and thickness of the stroke 


## Deployment 

Deployed with Netlify
